# Media

Most of this media is built using LaTeX, a profesional tool used to create industrial and scientific documentation,
presentations and other media through a text-based interface.

LaTeX can be written and rendered through the command line as entirely WYSIWYM (What You Say Is What You Mean) or you
can use a LaTeX editor (like me) where WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).

I would recomend kile for this: https://kile.sourceforge.io/

Storing documents as plaintext and rendering into epub, pptx or pdf is a great way to maintain compatability, but some editors
that nativly work with pptx or other formats may be more familer to some team members so those binary files, may also be stored
here.

# If you're using windows!

You'll need these two programs

 - kile https://kile.sourceforge.io/ (For editing files)
 - and tex engine https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe (Because windows dosent have it)

Pick up Kile, and load one of the `.tex` LaTeX files, start editing! If you're new to LaTeX, overleaf is a great guide!
